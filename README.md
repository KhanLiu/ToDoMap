## 1. Introduction

Have you ever experienced that when you want to search the location of your next work place but you have to switch different apps and copy paste many times? Here is why our **ToDoMap** comes out. This application aims to help users manage their work and life easily by visualizing todo tasks on a map.

This app is the course project of the **Mobile Cartography** course within the framework of [Cartography M.Sc.](https://cartographymaster.eu/) Programme.

Not only a todo management app **ToDoMap** is, but also a life record app it could be.

## 4. Development

#### 4.1 Task SQLite Database

Here is the structure and datatype of SQLite database, which will be created locally on the device when user firstly install **ToDoMap**.

| _id                               | title         | type | time | address | latitude | longitude | description |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|------|------|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | TEXT NOT NULL | TEXT | TEXT | TEXT    | DOUBLE   | DOUBLE    | TEXT        |

After tasks created, the data in database looks like:

#### 4.2 Fragment-based Bottom Navigation

The main activity of **ToDoMap** consists of three fragments (task view, map view, settings view), and uses a bottom navigation bar to manage different views. The app framework was shown in the following figure.
